# 3. OSGi, Bndtools and the Felix Web Console
OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) is a specification for a service platform that enables a dynamic component model in Java. This page briefly describes all the necessary concepts which are required to start developing for the FPAI. There are of course other resources which describe OSGi in much more detail.

The FPAI runs on top of the Apache Felix OSGi framework. For developing we recommend using the Apache Felix Web Console. For development we use Eclipse in combination with Bndtools.

## Your workspace
If you followed the steps in [[chapter 2|SettingUpYourIDE]], you should now have Eclipse with the Bndtools perspective.

You will notice that there are several views (parts of the userinterface). You can reorganize these views as you like.
